This a parking management system named as "Parking Space Bangladesh". I developed this system using PHP, HTML, CSS and BOOTSTRAP framework.

Through our system people can share their available parking spot with others who are looking for a spot to park their vehicle in the nearby area. 
This is a concept aims to help create a jam free city.
